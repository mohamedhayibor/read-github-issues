### Raison D'etre

Ever heard that code not written by you is hostile code. Welcome to the pack and embrace it. To measure how hostile a (repos, dependency) skimming at the issues can help decide if you are diving or not into the codebase to find out how it even works. This tool can even speed up your decision on which repos to contribute or learn from.
